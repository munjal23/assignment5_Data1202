In assignment 4, there were two questions:
1. Create a function to calculate the distribution of channeltype from the top 1000 records.

First we loaded our dataset file into python.
Then we took first 1000 records of dataset using 'iloc'.
After that we specifically took the channeltype column to calculate the distribution.
Then we created a function which will calculate the distribution of every channeltype.
And finnaly we called that fucntion and got our output.

3. Load only the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file.  

we created new csv file in our folder and loaded the top 1000 records which we got before into that csv file.
